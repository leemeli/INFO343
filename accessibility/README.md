# Accessibility Challenge

This folder contains code for a web page presenting an academic research paper, created as part of the Accessibility Challenge.

The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

##### Are the validator services reporting any errors for your site? Why are these "false positives"? #####
> The only known problem from the Accessibility checker is for the <i> tag. We were told to use this tag for words that are not in English or are abbreviations, so should be an exception.


##### What are the answers to your reading quiz questions? #####
> 1) Header tags, 2) True, 3) WCAG


##### Did you complete any optional extensions to this assignment? If so, what? #####
> I added some styling that was not required to help with the visual appearance but very minor (ex. margins)


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Nope


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 7 hours


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 8, it wasn't necessarily hard but I felt like I spent a lot of wasted time on busy work (looking for words in the PDF that are italicized)


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> See previous
