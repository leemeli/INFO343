  <b>Squidward Tentacles</b> is one of the main characters in the children's animated show <cite>Spongebob Squarepants</cite>.
  He works at the Krusty Krab as a cashier and is closely acquainted with Spongebob and Patrick.
  More information about Squidward can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squidward_Tentacles" alt="Wikipedia page about Squidward">here</a> at Wikipedia.

  I admire Squidward because he always has to deal with Spongebob and Patrick's bullcrap and I 
  feel like I relate to that deeply on a personal level. He isn't fakely nice to anybody and is blunt about how he feels.
