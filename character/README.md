##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 3-4 hours


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####

##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
